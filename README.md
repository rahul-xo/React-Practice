My React Practice Projects ðŸš€
A repo for all my React practice code.

1. Lifting State Up
Concept: A common React pattern where the state is "lifted" to the nearest common parent to share it between sibling components.

My Code: The state lives in LiftState.jsx and is shared between InputComponent.jsx and DisplayComponent.jsx.

2. Toggler Button
Concept: A simple UI component to handle on/off states, built using Tailwind CSS for styling.

My Code: The component is named TogglerButton.jsx and is located inside the Toggler folder.

- [View Code](src/Toggler)

3. useRef for Uncontrolled Forms
Concept: This project shows how to use the useRef hook to create an uncontrolled form. The form's data is read directly from the DOM on submit, instead of being managed by React state.
